## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### __My Career__

I have spent the last 6 years working in the beauty industry as a licensed hairstylist, customer service specialist, sales representative, and (most recently) merchandising associate. Though I love what I do, I'm looking for a change into something that will allow me to take my ideas and my creativity to the next level, which is why I've started at UofA!
