## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### __My Career__

I have spent the last 6 years working in the beauty industry as a licensed hairstylist, customer service specialist, sales representative, and (most recently) merchandising associate. Though I love what I do, I'm looking for a change into something that will allow me to take my ideas and my creativity to the next level, which is why I've started at UofA in Web Development!

### __Experience__

I discovered my love for tech a couple years ago when I built my first PC. I realized how much I loved picking out all the parts, making sure all the hardware fit together properly, and even the endless troubleshooting while I was trying to set everything up. This led me to taking a couple courses online in IT Fundamentals, and because I enjoyed those so much, I decided to further my education and work on getting a diploma through UofA./
Through these courses, I've gained some experience with coding languages like Python, JavaScript, and HTML, and with broader ideas like networks, IP and MAC addresses, operating systems, and more.
